# Getting Dirty with Blockchain Development
### Description
The Ethereum blockchain has a superpower - it allows us to code the blockchain using a language called Solidity. In this Armstrong led spike, we’re going to introduce Ethereum and Solidity and get messy with setting up our environment, writing a simple script, and diving into an application.

You’re not an expert and we aren’t either. Join our team as we move together from what we know to exploring what, as Dumbledore would say, are the thickets of wildest guesswork. It’s adventure time and everyone is welcome.
